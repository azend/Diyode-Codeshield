### So what is the Diyode Codeshield?
The Diyode Codeshield is an electronics powerpack filled with motors, lights, and sounds to get you going right out of the gate. It is also built atop the powerful and open source Arduino platform, equipping you with the massive software libraries and support that it has amassed.

### Getting your Codeshield
Unfortunately, Codeshields are currently not available for purchase. We are however selling some initial boards at various events and community activities we attend. If you'd really like to see an initial board, come out to Diyode Makers' Club and ask!
